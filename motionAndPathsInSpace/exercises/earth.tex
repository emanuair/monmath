\begin{exercise}
  The Earth travels in an orbit around the Sun that can be
  approximated by a circle. The distance from the Earth to the Sun is
  (on average) $1$
  \link[au]{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit}. We are
  going to make some models of the Earth's orbit in the
  $(x,y)$-plane. For all of our models, we will make the following
  assumptions:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The Sun will be at the origin.
  \item At the starting time, $t=0$, the Earth will be at the point
    $(1,0)$ in the $(x,y)$-plane.
  \item The Earth will travel in a counterclockwise direction around
    the Sun.
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{exercise}
    Give a parametrization of the Earth's orbit that will model the
    Earth's position in terms of $t$, where the units are years.
    \[
    \vec{y}(t) = \vector{\answer{\cos(2\pi t)},\answer{\sin(2\pi t)}} 
    \]
  \end{exercise}
  \begin{exercise}
    Give a parametrization of the Earth's orbit that will model the
    Earth's position in terms of $t$, where the units are months.
    \[
    \vec{m}(t) = \vector{\answer{\cos(2\pi t/12)},\answer{\sin(2\pi t/12)}} 
    \]
  \end{exercise}
  \begin{exercise}
    Give a parametrization of the Earth's orbit that will model the
    Earth's position in terms of $t$, where the units are days.
    \[
    \vec{d}(t) = \vector{\answer{\cos(2\pi t/365)},\answer{\sin(2\pi t/365)}} 
    \]
  \end{exercise}
  \begin{exercise}
    Given that the Earth's orbit has a circumference of $940$ million
    miles, give a parametrization of the Earth's orbit that will model
    the Earth's position in terms of $s$, the distance traveled in
    millions of miles.
    \[
    \vec{e}(s) = \vector{\answer{\cos(2\pi s/940)},\answer{\sin(2\pi s/940)}} 
    \]
    \begin{exercise}
      True or False: This is an arc length parameterization.
    \begin{multipleChoice}
      \choice[correct]{True}
      \choice{False}
    \end{multipleChoice}
    \begin{exercise}
      Compute:
      \[
      \vec{e}'(s)
      \begin{prompt}
        = \vector{\answer{(-\pi/470) \sin(2\pi s/940)},\answer{(\pi/470) \cos(2\pi s/940)}}
      \end{prompt}
      \]
      \begin{exercise}
        Compute:
        \[
        |\vec{e}'(s)| = \answer{\pi/470}
        \]
        \begin{feedback}
          Note this will not be $1$!
        \end{feedback}
        \begin{exercise}
          Why is the magnitude of the derivative not $1$?
          \begin{multipleChoice}
            \choice{We made a mistake.}
            \choice[correct]{The units are the key.}
          \end{multipleChoice}
          \begin{feedback}
            Note, $1\unit{au} =
            150\unit{million~miles}$. Multiplying $\pi/470\cdot 150
            \approx 1$.
