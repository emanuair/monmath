\begin{exercise}

The curve $C$ is given by the following set of parametric equations:

\[ \begin{cases}
x(t)=   4 \ln (t) \\
y(t)=   5 e^t\end{cases}
, t>0 \]

Eliminate the parameter and find a Cartesian representation of the given curve.  Solve for $x$ in your final answer.
\[
x= \answer{ 4\ln\left(\ln\left(\frac{t}{5} \right)\right)}
\]
(Write out $y$ in terms of $x$.)

\begin{exercise}
For the curve to have a vertical asymptote:

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{$x$ must become infinite as $y$ approaches a finite value.}
\choice[correct]{$y$ must become infinite as $x$ approaches a finite value.}
\end{multipleChoice}

How many vertical asymptotes does the curve have?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{$0$}
\choice{$1$}
\choice{$2$}
\choice{more than $2$}
\end{multipleChoice} 

(You should check your answer on Desmos!)
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
For the curve to have a horizontal asymptote:

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{$x$ must become infinite as $y$ approaches a finite value.}
\choice{$y$ must become infinite as $x$ approaches a finite value.}
\end{multipleChoice}

How many horizontal asymptotes does the curve have?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{$0$}
\choice[correct]{$1$}
\choice{$2$}
\choice{more than $2$}
\end{multipleChoice} 

The horizontal asymptote is $y=\answer{5}$.
