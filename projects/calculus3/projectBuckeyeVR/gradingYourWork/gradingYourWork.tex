\title{Grading your work}

\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
  Here is how you'll hand-in your work and how we will grade it.
\end{abstract}
\maketitle

Your work will be graded as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item $10\%$ for reading the instructions.
\item $40\%$ for each individual portion.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $10\%$ for handing it in.
  \item $10\%$ for each correct ``object'' (each individual portion has exactly $3$ objects).
  \end{itemize}
\item $50\%$ for the group portion.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $20\%$ for the M\"obius strip. 
  \item $30\%$ for the curve.
  \end{itemize}
\item A possible $5\%$ bonus for the extra credit. Students must be
  listed as collaborators on the extra-credit to receive credit.
\end{itemize}

You will hand in \textbf{a single document} on Carmen. This document
will have six section headings, each identifying what is being plotted
(you can just use the title of the appropriate subassignment).  Under
each section you will include:
\begin{itemize}
\item The name(s) of the group members who worked on the section.
\item A QR code for the relevant plot.
\item A URL for the relevant plot.
\end{itemize}

As an example, suppose a student ``Devyn Agathon'' worked on Intersecting Planes. They would write:
\begin{image}
  \includegraphics{PartAndName.png}
\end{image}
Next they would go to their image in BuckeyeVR and click the
``Generate QR'' button:
\begin{image}
  \includegraphics{generate.png}
\end{image}
Next they would copy the link to the QR code:
\begin{image}
  \includegraphics{QR.png}
\end{image}
Next they would click on the ``Embed Image'' button:
\begin{image}
  \includegraphics{EmbedImage.png}
\end{image}
And paste the link to the QR code:
\begin{image}
  \includegraphics{pasteQR.png}
\end{image}
To add a link, first they would go to their image in BuckeyeVR and
click the ``Generate URL'' button:
\begin{image}
  \includegraphics{generate.png}
\end{image}
Next, they would copy this URL
\begin{image}
  \includegraphics{copyURL.png}
\end{image}
Finally, they would click the ``Link to URL'' button, and paste the URL:
\begin{image}
  \includegraphics{URLButton.png}
\end{image}
