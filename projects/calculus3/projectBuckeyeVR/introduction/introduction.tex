\maketitle

Imagine yourself as a ``mathematician-for-hire'' and that the
\mooculus\ Virtual-Reality squad has hired you (for points, not cash)
to build some VR demos. You will work in groups of four, where each
group member is responsible for modeling a specific demo:
\begin{itemize}
\item One group member will make a demo showing the intersection of
  two planes.
\item One group member will make a demo showing two circles (a great
  circle and a regular circle) on a sphere.
\item One group member will make a demo showing the intersection of a
  sphere and a plane.
\item One group member will make a demo showing two circles on a
  torus.
\end{itemize}
Finally, as a \textbf{group}, you must make a demo showing a m\"obius
strip with a tube hovering above the side.

For extra credit, your group may submit a ``creative'' plot as well.
