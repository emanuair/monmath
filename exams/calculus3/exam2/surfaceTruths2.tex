  Which statements are necessarily true?
  \begin{selectAll}
    \choice{The function $F(x,y) = x^6+y^6$ locally looks like an elliptic
      paraboloid.}
    \choice{If $D(\vec{c})>0$, then $|\grad F(\vec{c})|>0$.}%% FIRST DERIV VS SECOND
    \choice{If $F^{(1,1)}(\vec{c})=0$, then $F$ has a maximum or minimum at $\vec{c}$.}
    \choice{If $F$ has a saddle-point at $(2,5)$, then there are unit vectors $\uvec{u}$ and $\uvec{v}$ such that $D_{\uvec{u}}(F(2,5))>0$ and $D_{\uvec{v}}(F(2,5))<0$.} %% GRAD IS ZERO
    \choice{If $F$ has a saddle-point at $(1,-1)$ and $G$ has a saddle-point at $(1,-1)$, then $F+G$ has a saddle-point at $(1,-1)$.}
    \choice[correct]{None of these.}
