\textbf{How to take the exam:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Print out the PDF of the exam (or work on a separate sheet of paper).
  \item Take the exam for around $55$ minutes. If it is easy and you
    have solved all the problems, you may finish early. If you are
    stuck, try to fight-it-out for the full time.
  \item Check your answers online with Ximera. The Ximera version of
    the practice exam will be posted online sometime after the PDF is
    posted.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Things to know:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The real exam is \textbf{not} limited to question from the practice
  exam.
\item \textbf{Any topic from the course is fair-game for an in-class
  examination}.
\item At least 50\% of the real exam will be very similar to content
  found on the practice exams.
\item The exam will cover content from the first day of class to Wednesday, September $12$th.
\end{itemize}
