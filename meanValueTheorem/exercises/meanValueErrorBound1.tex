Consider the function $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$.  

The linear approximation to $f$ at $a=4$ is
\[
L(x) = \answer{\frac{1}{4}(x-4) + 2}.
\]

We use this to approximate $\sqrt{4.1}$ as
\[
\sqrt{4.1} \approx 2 + \frac{1}{\answer{40}}.
\]

We will now use the mean value theorem to produce rigorous upper and lower bounds for the value of $\sqrt{4.1}$.  Applying the mean value theorem to $f$ on the interval $[4,4.1]$ gives us
\[
\frac{f\left(\answer{4.1}\right) - f(4)}{\answer{0.1}} = f'(c)
\]
for some $\answer{4}<c<\answer{4.1}$.  We can solve for $f(4.1) = \sqrt{4.1}$ in the above expression to give us
\[
\sqrt{4.1} = \frac{f'(c)}{\answer{10}} + \answer{2}.
\]

Now we know that $f'$ is \wordChoice{\choice{increasing}\choice[correct]{decreasing}} so since $4<c<9$
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{$f'(4)<f'(c)<f'(9)$.}
\choice[correct]{$f'(9)<f'(c)<f'(4)$.}
\end{multipleChoice}
We use these bounds to find that 
\[
2+\frac{1}{\answer{60}} < \sqrt{4.1} < 2+\frac{1}{\answer{40}}.
\]
Thus our estimate from the linear approximation of $f$ can be off by at most $\answer{\frac{1}{40}-\frac{1}{60}}$.
