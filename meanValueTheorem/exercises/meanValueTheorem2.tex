Consider the function $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ on the interval $[0,16]$.

The equation for the linear approximation of $f$ at $a=4$ is
\[
L(x) = \answer{\frac{1}{4}(x-4)+2}.
\]

Using the linear approximation we can estimate $\sqrt{5}$ as 
\[
\sqrt{5} \approx \answer{2.25}.
\]

The Mean Value Theorem \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{does}\choice{does not}} apply to $f$ on $[0,16]$ and the point $c$ guaranteed to exist is $c=\answer{4}$. (Write \verb|DNE| if the Mean Value Theorem does not apply.)
