\begin{exercise}

	A student's attempt to evaluate the limit $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{x^3+x}{x}$ using limit laws is recorded below.  From one line to the next, only one limit law should be utilized.  Which of the following options best describes the student's work?
	
	\begin{align*}
		\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{x^3 + x}{x} &= \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{x(x^2+1)}{x}\\
		&= x^2+1
	\end{align*}
	
	\begin{multipleChoice}
		\choice{The work is perfect}
		\choice{The answer is correct, but the student skipped some steps, or made a mistake along the way}
		\choice[correct]{The answer is incorrect}
	\end{multipleChoice}
	
	\begin{feedback}
		It never makes sense for the limiting variable to appear in the answer to a limit.
	\end{feedback}
