\begin{exercise}

	A student's attempt to evaluate the limit $\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^3-1}{x-1}$ using limit laws is recorded below.  Which of the following options best describes the student's work?
	
	\begin{align*}
		\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^3-1}{x-1} &= \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{(x-1)(x^2+x+1)}{x-1}\\
		&= \lim_{x \to 1} \left( x^2 + x + 1\right)\\
		&= 3
	\end{align*}
	
	\begin{multipleChoice}
		\choice{The work is perfect}
		\choice[correct]{The answer is correct, but the student skipped some steps, or made a mistake along the way}
		\choice{The answer is incorrect}
	\end{multipleChoice}
	
	\begin{feedback}
		While the students answer is correct, certain intermediate steps were bypassed.   A complete solution would have included an application of the sum rule and power rule, for instance.
	\end{feedback}
