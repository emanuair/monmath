\begin{exercise}
A bug is crawling along the spoke of a wheel that lies along a radius
of the wheel. The bug is crawling at $1$ unit per second and the wheel
is rotating at $1$ radian per second (counterclockwise when looked at
from the positive $x$ axis). Suppose the wheel lies in the
$(y,z)$-plane with center at the origin, and at time $t = 0$ the spoke
lies along the positive $y$-axis and the bug is at the origin. Find a
vector function $\vec{p}(t)$ for the position of the bug at time $t$.
\begin{prompt}
\[
\vec{p}(t)=\vector{\answer{0},\answer{t\cos(t)},\answer{t\sin(t)}}
\]
\end{prompt}
