\begin{exercise}
  A standard LP record is $12\unit{in}$ in diameter and spins at
  $33+\frac{1}{3}$ rotations per minute in a clockwise direction. An
  ant starts at the center of the record and walks to the edge along a
  radius at a speed of $(1/4)\unit{in/sec}$. Working in inches and
  seconds, assuming that the center of the record is at the origin,
  and that at time $t=0$, the ant is headed directly to the right
  along the $x$-axis, write a vector-valued function $\vec{a}$ that
  describes the ant's path.
  \begin{prompt}
    \[
    \vec{a}(t) = \vector{
      \answer{(t/4)\cos(-(33+1/3) 2\pi t/60)},
      \answer{(t/4)\sin(-(33+1/3) 2\pi t/60)}
    }
    \]
  \end{prompt}
\end{exercise}
