\begin{exercise}
  A model rocket is fired from a launch pad $1\unit{meter}$ above the
  ground with an initial velocity of
  $\vector{3,4,50}\unit{m}/\unit{s}$ (where the positive
  $x$-direction is East, the positive $y$-direction is North, and the
  positive $z$-direction is Up). A crosswind blowing to the North
  accelerates the rocket $2\text{m}/\text{s}^2$. Give a formula for
  the position of the rocket in terms of time. Let the acceleration
  due to gravity be $-10\unit{m}/\unit{s}^2$.
  \begin{hint}
    Start by writing $\vec{r}''(t) = \vector{0,2,-10}$.
  \end{hint}
  \[
  \vec{r}(t) = \vector{\answer{3t},\answer{t^2+4t},\answer{-5t^2+50t+1}}
  \]
