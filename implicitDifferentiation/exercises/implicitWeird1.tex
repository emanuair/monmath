Consider the curve  $y^2 = x^2(x+1)$, whose graph is given below:

\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\begin{axis}[
            xmin=-2,xmax=2,ymin=-2,ymax=2,
            axis lines=center,
	   ticks=none,
            xlabel=$x$, ylabel=$y$,
            every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
            every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
          ]        
          \addplot [very thick, penColor, smooth, samples=100, domain=(-2:2)] ({x^2-1},{x^3-x});
        \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}

Use implicit differentiation to write $\frac{dy}{dx}$ as a function of both $x$ and $y$.

\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = \answer{\frac{3x^2+2x}{2y}}
\]

The equation of the tangent line to this curve at the point $(3,6)$ is

\[
y = \answer{\frac{11}{4}(x-3)+6}
\]

A difficult point to analyze on this graph is the point $(0,0)$, since
it looks like two intersecting lines there.  We would like to know the
equation of these two ``tangent lines.''  Our formula for
$\frac{dy}{dx}$ provides no help, initially, since we get
$\frac{0}{0}$ when we plug $(0,0)$ into that formula.

Since the formula only breaks down at the point $(0,0)$, a way forward
is to try to take a limit of slopes as $(x,y)$ approaches $(0,0)$
along the curve.

We can solve for the ``top part'' of the curve as $y =
\sqrt{x^2(x+1)}$.  The other half of the curve is $y =
-\sqrt{x^2(x+1)}$.

Using $y = \sqrt{x^2(x+1)}$, we see that for points in the first
quadrant of the plane, we can write $\frac{dy}{dx}$ as a function of
$x$ as
\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = \answer{\frac{3x^2+2x}{2\sqrt{x^2(x+1)}}}
\]
and
\[
\lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{dy}{dx} = 1
\]
Thus equations of the two ``tangent lines'' are $y=x$ and $y=-x$.

We could have also arrived at this result more intuitively in the following way:

In the equation $y^2 = x^2+x^3$, when $x$ is very close to $0$, all of
the terms will be very small, but the term $x^3$ will be small even
compared to $x^2$.  So the curve should look a lot like the curve $y^2
= x^2$ close to $(0,0)$.  But $y^2 = x^2$ is equivalent to
$(y-x)(y+x)=0$, which is exactly the pair of lines $y=x$ and $y=-x$.
