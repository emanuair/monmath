Use implicit differentiation to find $\frac{dy}{dx}$ as a function of $x$ and $y$ where
\[
x^2 = y^2.
\]
\begin{prompt}
\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = \answer{\frac{x}{y}}
\]
\end{prompt}
What is the equation of the tangent line to this curve at the point $(1,-1)$?
\begin{prompt}
\[
y = \answer{-x}
\]
\end{prompt}
Can you understand this intuitively?  What is the graph of $y^2 = x^2$?
