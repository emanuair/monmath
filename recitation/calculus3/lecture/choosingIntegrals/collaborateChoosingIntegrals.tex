\title[Collaborate:]{Choosing integrals}

\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
We give ourselves a choice of integrals to compute.
\end{abstract}
\maketitle

\textbf{Work in groups of 3--4, writing your answers on a separate
  sheet of paper.}

For each of the following problems, use either the divergence theorem
or Stokes' theorem to set-up integrals that will compute the desired
result.



\begin{problem}
  Compute the flux of
  \[
  \vec{F}(x,y,z) = \vector{x,-y,z}
  \]
  across the unit cube in the first octant.
\end{problem}



\begin{problem}
  Compute the circulation of
  \[
  \vec{F}(x,y,z) = \vector{3x,4y,5z}
  \]
  along the surface defined by the lower hemisphere of $x^2 + y^2 +
  z^2 = 4$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Compute the flux of
  \[
  \vec{F}(x,y,z) = \vector{-y,x-z,y}
  \]
  across the cone of radius $6$ and height $2$ whose base is in the
  $(x,y)$-plane.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Compute the circulation of
  \[
  \vec{F}(x,y,z) = \vector{x+y,y+z,x+z}
  \]
  along the surface enclosed by the tilted circle
  \[
  \vec{p}(t) = \vector{\cos(t), 2\sin(t),\sqrt{3}\cos(t)}.
  \]
\end{problem}
