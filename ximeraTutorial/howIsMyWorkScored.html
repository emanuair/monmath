<!--l. 7--><p class="noindent">We explain how your work is scored.
</p></div>   <div class="maketitle"></div>
We want you to learn from this text. Hence, we ask questions to “push” your
thinking, and leave blanks in examples to ensure you are following along. We
encourage you to <strong>keep a notebook</strong> where you write each question and your answers,
along with each major theorem and example. In essence we want you to imagine that
<strong>we are writing mathematics together</strong>, and thus are exploring a new world of
mathematics together.
<!--l. 19--><p class="noindent">With this in mind, your work is graded on the basis of its correct <strong>completion</strong>. The
green bar above </p><div class="image-environment" role="img" aria-labelledby="image-alt-1"><img src="partialBar.png" alt="PIC"/> </div>
tells you how close you are to completion. We hope that you can complete each
activity and see a full green bar: <div class="image-environment" role="img" aria-labelledby="image-alt-2"><img src="fullGreen.png" alt="PIC"/> </div>
However, sometimes there is a bug that prohibits a “full green bar.” In that case, do
not despair, as we take these bugs into account when grading. Moreover,
please <strong>let us know</strong> any issues you are having. If possible <strong>we will fix the
issue</strong>.
<!--l. 34--><p class="noindent">If a correction is made then we may make an update. In this case an orange button
will appear at the top of the screen: </p><div class="image-environment" role="img" aria-labelledby="image-alt-3"><img src="update.png" alt="PIC"/> </div>
If you click the “update” button, a dialog will appear: <div class="image-environment" role="img" aria-labelledby="image-alt-4"><img src="updateDialog.png" alt="PIC"/> </div>
If you update your work, the current activity will be replaced by a new activity. Since
your previous work was for the previous incarnation of the activity, your
previous work will be deleted. However, if you’ve completed the activity, <strong>your
record of completion remains</strong>. You can witness this by selecting another
activity, and observing your green-bar for the updated activity. Unfortunately,
if your activity was not complete before you updated and you want a full
green-bar on the updated activity, you will have to complete the activity
again.
<!--l. 53--><p class="noindent">We simply want you to learn and to provide you with the best possible learning
experience.
