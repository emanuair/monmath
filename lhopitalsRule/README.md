# L'Hopital's rule

This section needs to be written.

L'Hopital's rule is about using an essentially geometric trick to
compute a limit. 

Make students check the conditions of l'Hopital's rule to make the
rule less seductive; this way they will be forced to think of a
simpler approeach (like recognizing the limit as the definition of a
derivative).

Could have a checklist in each example for the computation
